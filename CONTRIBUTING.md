# Contributing to Lumens Community

Thanks for your interest! A few pointers to get started:

- Policies live under `policies/<community>/<vertical>/policy.yaml`.
- Validate policies locally: `pip install jsonschema pyyaml && python tools/validate_policy.py`.
- Open PRs against `main`. Policy changes trigger CI validation.

Workflow
- Fork → branch → PR. Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
- Use clear commit messages (Conventional Commits preferred).
- For policy changes, include rationale and sample channels/items.
